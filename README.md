## Details 

* **website-ristoria** is a responsive restaurant website
* It is designed for *"Ristoria de' Monaldeschi"* award winning restaurant in Orvieto, Italy
* It is social friendly and provide a direct connection to reserve a seat
* Demo version (fully functional) is [here](https://silviotorre.github.io/website-ristoria/ "Ristoria demo site")
* Website use Html+CSS+Javascript (Parallax framework)

### Take notes ;-)

* If you are in Italy my advice is to plan to visit Orvieto, a medieval city sits atop a volcanic cliff, watching over Umbria below
* If you do so next step is to go to [Ristoria de' Monaldeschi](http://ristoria.eu/ "Ristoria de' Monaldeschi") and ask for "Umbrichelli al Tartufo" with a glass of wine "Orvieto Classico".
